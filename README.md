# 1. Context switch

## a) Procedure

1. P2 blocks awaiting data from P1.
2. P1 marks the starting time.
3. P1 sends token to P2.
4. P1 attempts to read a response token from P2. This induces a context switch.
5. P2 is scheduled and receives the token.
6. P2 sends a response token to P1.
7. P2 attempts read a response token from P1. This induces a context switch.
8. P1 is scheduled and receives the token.
9. P1 marks the end time.

# 4. How Does CPU Cache Work and What Are L1, L2, and L3?

## a) CPU Cache

computer memory hierachy (fast to slow): 
1) cache, closest to where the central processing occurs, being a part of the CPU itself.
2) Random Access Memory, commonly known as the RAM.
3) a primary storage, like a hard disk or an SSD, which stores the bulk of the dataâ€”the operating system and all the programs.

Cache is a Static RAM (SRAM), as compared to the system RAM, which is a Dynamic RAM (DRAM). Static RAM is one that can hold data without needing to be constantly refreshed, unlike DRAM, which makes SRAM ideal to be used for cache.

# Perf

Perf is a profiler tool for Linux based system that abstracts away CPU hardware differences in Linux performance measurements and presents a simple commandline interface.
